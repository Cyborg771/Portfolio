                            <p>emcee was an iOS 7 app designed for an upper division interface design course at SFU. We wanted to create a service that would push users to find spontaneous events and activities to participate in around their city. The system would hypothetically learn a user's interests based on their past behaviour and social circles. Results could then be filtered by popularity, distance, and time.</p>

                            <p>My role on the team was primarily as the graphic designer. I created various high fidelity mockups based on skethces provided to me using Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, HTML, and CSS. In addition I collaborated with another team mate on the UX design aspect of the project, helping to produce and test interactive prototypes and optimizing the experience of using the app.</p>

                            <p>We started with white board and paper sketches in order to nail down the general flow of the application. A lot of focus was paid to how we presented the homepage, which kinds of events would be most prominent, how many events to show, and how much to prioritize time vs location when choosing events. Once we were happy with these sketches I got to work creating more detailed wireframes in Adobe Illustrator. These wireframes included every page the user could visit so we could be sure we hadn't missed any major elements of the user experience.</p>

                            <p>After deciding on our layout I worked with another designer to create a style guide dictating colour and iconographic standards for the project. We tried to keep these decisions in line with the iOS 7 style guide which had recently been released. I then got to work creating high fidelity mockups of the final UI. We then hooked these mockups into a simple interactive demo using HTML and CSS which we then tested with various users. Their feedback helped us polish the rough edges and complete the design.

                            <p>Rocket Blocks is a single player arcade puzzle game in the spirit of Bust-a-Move and Meteos. The player receives a series of randomized blocks which fly upwards from the bottom of the screen. They must navigate these blocks into position in an ever growing wall of blocks at the top of the screen. Points are scored by matching colours and symbols. Achieving a high enough combo will let the player clear blocks away.</p>

                            <h2>Role: Game Designer</h2>
                            <p>I created Rocket Blocks over a few weeks in the summer of 2012 as a side project for fun. I worked alone so all of the art, design, and programming were done by me. I used Adobe Photoshop to create the visuals and programmed the game in Adobe Flash using Actionsctipt 3. The only element of the game not created by me is the music, which is a royalty free and acquired from Kevin Macleod's website <a href="http://www.incomptech.com">incomptech.com</a>.</p>

                            <p>Work on Rocket Blocks began on paper. Much of the design was unchanged from my original sketches. I first created a vertical slice prototype over the course of a few days. It included many elements of the final game but was too slow and buggy and so it was scrapped. Taking what I had learned I simplified the code to reduce memory usage and increase performance. The remaining time was spent on visuals and game feel. A lot of attention was paid to the frequency of various special blocks. The final version of the game has been meticulously balanced so that a skilled player can continue playing almost indefinitely.

Of the 736 entrants, Compositions placed 4th in the category of theme and 93rd overall.</p>

The predictive keyboard in the BB10 operating system was one of my biggest and most influential projects. The team was tasked with improving upon the existing predictive text features available in most commerical touch screen phones. The final result can be seen in more detail <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6iNAeXson8&feature=youtube_gdata">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>My role on the team was originally just to develop interactive prototypes of software solutions for testing and communication purposes. After working there for a while I was allowed to participate in design meetings as well. I primarily used Adobe Flash and Actionscript 3 to create these prototypes, but when a less interactive approach was required I would use After Effects and a green screened phone to show ideas visually.</p>

                            <p>WordWorks was one of my first ever games, and also on of my biggest successes. It is a combination of traditional word search games such as Boggle and pattern matching games such as Bejeweled. Primarily it was made is an experiment and was the first game I ever polished enough to release publicly.</p>

                            <p>WordWorks was my first attempt at making a fully polished and releasable game, and subsequently was one of my greatest successes. I did all of the design and programming while the art and music were handled by my partner. </p>

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>After initially coming up with the concept for WordWorks I got to work on a prototype. Considerable time was spent on optimizing the letter randomization and the dictionary searching. Upon release the game grew surprisingly popular in Vietnam and other Asian countries. Further investigation showed that these players were coming from English tutoring sites. By the time the monetization and stat tracking platform went out of business the game had roughly 350,000 unique sessions over three years.</p>
